// Between a table and its music. The music is played by the sound card's clock, on a thread
// of its own (engine/audio/MusicDriver.h), and the table by the screen's; and the table goes
// by the music: a jingle that ends lets the next thing happen. So that a game can still be
// played again exactly, the table never looks at the music as it is, but at a view of it:
// the music as it was when the frame began, and what the table itself has done to it since.
// Whenever the view has moved on by itself between two frames, a recording notes the new one
// (Recording::Event::Kind::Music); a game played from a recording is given those instead, and
// sees the music exactly as the game that was played did, whatever the card was doing.
//
// The view is what the original keeps of its music (cs:3a6a, cs:5c3f): the place in the song,
// whether it has just been told to go there, how often the jingle is still to be repeated,
// its priority, the place to go back to after it, and whether the music is switched off.
// All but the first two are in the table's own memory, where its rules read and write them.
