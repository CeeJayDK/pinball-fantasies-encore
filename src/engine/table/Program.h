// A table program's memory, and the means to write its routines again (docs/own-engine.md).
//
// The original keeps all a table knows in its data segment, with a few variables among its
// code. A Program starts from those bytes, as they are in the player's TABLEn.PRG, and the
// engine's routines read and write them where the original's do.
//
// The four programs hold the same engine at different addresses. The engine's code is written
// once, against Party Land's addresses, and every access goes through the table's map (found
// by lining the programs up: re/align.py, Maps.inc). A table's own rules are written against
// its own addresses, with the *Native accessors.
