# publish-art.sh — makes a folder of HD pictures (assets/hd by default) the set every game
# fetches. Only the pictures the server does not have yet are uploaded; then the set is
# published as the next version. Going back is running it on the older pictures (from an
# older checkout): they are all still there, so only the set is written.
#
#   ENCORE_API      the Worker, e.g. https://thebestpinball.com
#   PUBLISH_TOKEN   the Worker's secret of the same name
#   ART_FORMAT      optional, 1 if not given: what a game must understand to use these
#                   pictures (kArtFormat in src/game/Art.h); older games keep the set they have
#   publish-art.sh [folder]
